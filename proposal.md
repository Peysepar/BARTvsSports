# BART vs Sports
## An analysis of BART ridership in comparison to professional sports games in the Bay Area

The goal of this project is to figure out what sports teams in the Bay Area (of those accessible by BART) create the greatest increase in BART ridership, and where these riders are coming from. Ideally, BART would be able to use this data (i.e. a comparison of BART ridership to game day and times) to redistribute BART resources effectively during game days for each professional sports team. 

I plan to use data on BART ridership by hour, available from the [BART website](http://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership) in addition to sports game dates and times for the Golden State Warriors, the Oakland Raiders, the Oakland Athletics, and the San Francisco Giants, as all 4 teams are accessible by BART, specifically those based in Oakland. That data is available on [Basketball Reference](basketball-reference.com), [Pro Football Reference](pro-football-reference.com), and [Baseball Reference](baseball-reference.com).

The questions I intend to answer are as follows:
* How much higher is BART ridership to/from stadium stops on game days?
* Which stations have the greatest and least amount of increase in ridership to and from stadium stops on game days?
* Which team creates the greatest average increase in ridership?


My deliverables will include the code used to clean and analyze the data, as well as the original and cleaned data itself. I will also include a presentation of the results of my comparisons including graphs to easily view the pertinent information.
